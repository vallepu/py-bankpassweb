[BankPass Web](http://www.bankpass.it/) is an on-line payment system promoted by the Italian Banking Association and re-sold by a large number of Italian banks.

py-bankpassweb is a Python interface for the BankPass Web e-commerce service. It can be used stand-alone, but it also includes a module to enable the use of BankPass Web with the [Satchmo](http://www.satchmoproject.com) e-commerce software, a truly remarkable e-shop and framework running on top of [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com). Check the Wiki page for SatchmoInstallation.

This is still very much in alpha status.
